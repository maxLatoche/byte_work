# Writing your Resume

#### Introduction

* A resume is not the only thing that matters in getting a job. 
* Networking and Interviewing is just as if not more important than your resume. 
* Your resume is a highlight reel
* You must be active and persistant with reaching out to contacts. Don't wait!
	
#### Writing Your Resume

***Typos MATTER!***

* Your resume must be consistent
* Put periods on all your sentences or none of them. There is no middle ground
* Everything must be written the same way. If you write JS as "JavaScript" it should be written like that everywhere
	* DO NOT have one bullet say "PostgreSQL" and another say "PSQL"
	* This also goes for dates, font sizes, font styles, bold, underlined, and especially tenses
* `This consistency must be seen on EVERYTHING`
	* Wording, tenses, dates, everything
	* Any resume you post on a job site
	* Your LinkedIn Account
	* Anything sent to recruiters
* Your LinkedIn can be longer than your resume. 
* Your resume is the highlight reel you choose to show to the specific job you are applying for. 

***Sentence and Phrasing***

* When discussing your accomplishments remember that it's not always a programmer reading your resume
* It could be a person from Human Resources or even a tech recruiter looking for some buzzwords
* Make sure to explain your accomplishments in a way that appeals to as many audiences as possible
* Write your resume using this pattern
	* `Verb -> Accomplishment -> Technologies` 
* You can then follow with more information about that project

```

```

* Your experiences carry more weight than your education
	* UNLESS you are just getting out of school, or have no experience yet.
	* Or you went to a very prestigious institution
* Your experiences should always include
	* Your title 
	* The dates you were there. (can be month/year, doesn't need to include the day)
	* Company name
	* Location 
	* Your responsibilities and accomplishments
		* Try to make this part as relevant as possible to the job you are applying to
* Speak more to your results and quantify them wherever you can. USE NUMBERS!!!
* Accomplishments holds more value than what your responsibilities were

***Your Resume Should Have The Following***

* `Contact Info` - ALWAYS at the top of the page
	* Name
	* Github
	* LinkedIn
	* Email
	* Phone
	* Portfolio Page
* `Skill Section`
	* There should be a clear section for you to list your skills
	* You should put the most relevant skills to that specific job at the top
		* `If a job wants javascript move your javascript skills to the top of the section`
		* `If it wants python move your python skills to the top of the section`
* `Work History / Experiences`
	* This should be towards the top of the page
	* Your projects should be included in the Experience section

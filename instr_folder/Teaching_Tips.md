## How To Format A Lesson Plan. 

***These three sections represent the skeleton of how to organize a lesson plan***

#### Learning Objectives

* Learning Objectives are items that can be measured/demonstrated
* We `DO NOT` use subjective words for learning objectives. Examples are:
	* `students will understand`
	* `students will learn`
* Learning objectives should describe the students showing us something. Examples are:
	* `Students will be able to draw out an ERD using schema designer`
	* `Students will be able to utilize a for loop and a while loop`
	* `Students will build a SQLite3 wrapper`

#### Context

* A small section describing why we are learning this. 
* Could be 1 to 3 sentences
* Offers the students insight on the larger picture and how this lesson fits into the end goal
* Why are we learning this? 
* Why is this important?
* What is the purpose of todays lesson?
* Example:
	* `We are learning about file I/O because it is an introduction to passing data back and forth between files. All of programming revolves around passing data to and from different places.`

#### Lessons

* This is the largest section and the main section
* Start from `Part 1` and continue into as many parts as you need
* Make sure these parts `scaffold` one on top of the other. 
	* No two parts should be completely different from each other, they should build off each other
* Try to input very light "Five Minute Exercises" throughout your lessons

## Teaching Practices / How to create an active learning environment

* Five Minute Exercises
	* These are small exercises meant to be done in class
	* They will help to keep the students engaged
	* It follows the `I do, You do` style of teaching
* White Board Exercises - 
	* Use the white board and have students come up as a group or individually to write on it and answer questions
* Fist of Five - 
	* A quick check where the student raises their hand and indicate how much they understand the lesson so far with. 
	* They do this by showing 1 finger (very confused), 5 fingers (complete understanding), or anything inbetween. 
	* Follow up with this if needed
* Thought Questions -
	* Feel free to pause from the lesson plan and ask a thought question
	* These might be conceptual to help students think about certain ideas
	* Example: "Now that we learned about MVC what may be the benefits of formatting our code this way?"
* Breaks!!!
	* Never talk for an hour or more straight without having some form of activity / break in between
* Stay on track!!!
	* Follow your lesson plan
	* Do not go off topic
	* If a student ask a question that does not relate to the Learning Objectives shut it down (respectfully)
	* You can utilize a `Parking Lot` for this
* Parking Lot -
	* Make a markdown and fill it with questions from the classroom that you did not know the answer to or did not want the answer to.
	* Example:
		* "What kind of sorting algorithm does the built in sort method use?"
		* "Thats a great question, let's parking lot that for now so we can stay on task. I'll put something in the parking lot later today about it."

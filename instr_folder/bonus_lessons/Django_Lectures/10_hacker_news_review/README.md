# Hacker News Clone

##### Description

* This exercise is to create your own [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com) clone from scratch. 
* It is meant to incorporate many of the skills we learned this month.
* Feel free to work together for the planning / pseudo coding / wireframing
* HOWEVER, I would like for this prompt to be done solo on your own branches. 

##### Objectives

* Visit the hacker news links above
* Pseudo code / ERD / Wireframe / User Stories
* You will need at least three models
	* Posts
	* Users
		* make sure to link this to the Django Users
	* Comments
* Make a simple user login, nothing complex
* Create a seed file so you can practice with some dummy data
	* [Faker](https://github.com/joke2k/faker) - a cool python package that allows you to generate dummy data
* Think about when it is better to use AJAX
	* Maybe we could use the `$.ajax` or `$.get` methods to grab our data faster
	* Remember AJAX is used here to pass data back and forth without having to re-render the page
	* Maybe use DOM manipulation to populate and empty certain divs. 

##### Bonus 

* Add comments onto comments
	* You can do this using Generic Relations
* Try using a PostgreSQL DB instead of SQLITE3 DB
* Use SEMANTIC HTML5 Tags

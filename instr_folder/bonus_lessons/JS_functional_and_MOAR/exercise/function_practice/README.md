# Functional Practice!!!

* Open up the `index.html` file and take a look at the information inside of the `script` tag
* Build functions `IN ES6` that will accomplish the goals in the comments
* Open the file in the browser and check out your console to see if your answers are correct.

***Note***

* The answers may be in the examples folder but DO NOT LOOK AT IT
* Try to get as much practice in as possible building out these functions in ES6. 
* The more time you spend grasping these concepts and how to utilize these functions the easier Learning React, or just programming in general will be.

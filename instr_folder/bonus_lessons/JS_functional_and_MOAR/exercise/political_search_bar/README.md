# Political Search

##### Files

* You've been given a `data.js` file. This is one giant JavaScript object that holds information for U.S. Legislators.
* Three starter files have been created for you. `index.html, `style.css`, `main.js`
* The HTML file has linked the `normalize` cdn along with the `data.js` file

##### Objectives

* You will build a front end sorting and filtering application utilizing the `data.js` file.
* Your search bar should allow users to:
	* Sort by last name A-Z and Z-A
	* Sort by state A-Z and Z-A
* Your search bar should allow users to:
	* Filter by last name
	* Filter by state
	* Filter by party
	* Filter by chamber
* Build a function that will update your data, so that
	* `gender: "F"` is now gender: `"Female"`
	* `party: "R"` is now party: `"Republican"`
* Build the HTML and CSS of the search bar. 

##### Notes

* Do not being coding right away.
* Take a look at the data
* Wireframe your page
* How do you want the filter sort bar to look?
* Will there be drop down menus? Radio Buttons? Text Inputs?
* Will you build your css from scratch or will you use a CSS Grid Framework?

# Your First React App!!!

* This exercise will be centered around [Facebooks new tutorial](https://facebook.github.io/react/tutorial/tutorial.html#what-were-building)
* You will be building a Tic Tac Toe application
* The final result should look like this [https://s.codepen.io/ericnakagawa/debug/ALxakj](https://s.codepen.io/ericnakagawa/debug/ALxakj)
* This tutorial is great because it focuses strictly on how react works without going into the Companion technologies needed to get everything set up. 
* Visit this link [https://codepen.io/jingo/pen/oBGdgN](https://codepen.io/jingo/pen/oBGdgN) and Fork it to your own Codepen account. 
* React is huge so feel free to follow along with the facebook tutorial first, and then try rebuilding it on your own.

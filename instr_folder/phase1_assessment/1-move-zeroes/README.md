Move the Zeroes
================

* Write a function that takes a list as an argument.
* This list has a random integers.
* Build a function that will move all the 0's to the end of the list 
* Return the new format
* Example

```
x = [0,1,0,3,12]
y = [6, 9, 0, 0, 0, 12, 13, 0, 24]

move_zeroes(x) == [1,3,12,0,0]
move_zeroes(y) == [6, 9, 12, 13, 24, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

##### Bonus

* Can you do this `in-place`. This means you cannot make a copy of this array/list.
* If you already solved this problem move on. If you have extra time try to complete the bonus.

ORM Save
========

You're going to write the save function for your Python Object Relational Mapper. You want to be able to take any number or arguments from whatever table is supplied, and either create the row, if it doesn't exist, or update the row, if it does exist.
Things you'll that may help you code this:

* set attr() and hasattr()
* __name__
* type(self)
* ** (this is usually written as **kwargs. It's the ** that matters, kwargs is just convention)
* __dict__

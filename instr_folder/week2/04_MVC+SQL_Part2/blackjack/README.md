* Your project is to build a command line black jack application in Python

#### MVP

* `10` /`J` / `Q`/ `K` - are all counted as 10
* `Ace` can be counted as a 10 or a 1
* There should be at least 1 deck with 52 cards
* Player should have the option to hit or stay
* Dealer should know when to hit or stay
* When either the player or dealer bust they automatically lose
* `bust` when a player/dealer has a combination of cards that go over 21

#### Luxury Goals

* `split` - when a player has two of the same cards in one hand they can have the option to split that hand into two separate hands
* Have the user choose between playing with 1 or 3 or 5 decks of cards
* Incorporate betting into the game
* Incorporate persistant data into the game using SQLite3

# Schema Designer

##### Description

* We've discussed ERD's in class
* We've drawn out a couple of them
* Now we're going to use this [SQL schema designer](http://ondras.zarovi.cz/sql/demo/) for some more practice
* If the schema designer is giving you problems draw our your ERDS on paper, take a picture of it with your phone, and save it to your computer to send to Github

##### Objectives

* Create an ERD for the following examples
* Once you are finished take a screen shot and upload them to this repo (OF YOUR BRANCH)

***ART GALLERY***

An art gallery needs to upgrade their systems.

Galleries keep information about artists, their names (which are unique), birthplaces, age, and style of art.

For each piece of artwork, the artist, the year it was made, its unique title, its type of art (e.g., painting, lithograph, sculpture, photograph), and its price must be stored.

Pieces of artwork are also classified into groups of various kinds, for example, portraits, still lifes, works by Picasso, or works of the 19th century; a given piece may belong to more than one group.

You don't have to model exactly this. Think about what your art gallery is going to sell and it's interaction with customers.

Model what you think the database needs for the beginning of the business, and build the model so that it has room to grow into its future needs.

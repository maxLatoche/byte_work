# Advanced Python and Some Population Stuff

##### Description

* Your goal here is to read a CSV file using some of the cool Python tools we've just learned today, especially generators, list comprehensions, kwargs, and ternary operators.
* Don't worry about using a database, OOP, or the MVC structure.
* Okay so I couldn't find a easily downloadable file for fun data like movies or music, so we're going to use this bland population data.
* For this `population` exercise, you will be using the population.csv file. 
* Once you are finished with these prompts, refactor your weekend terminal trader application, and complete the vocabulary review if you have not done so. 

 
***NOTE***

* Don't forget you have access to Pythons built in methods. (`sort`, `reverse`, and the like)

### Using Population.csv

##### Objective 1 - States

* How many people live in 'CA'
* How many people live in 'FL'
* How many people live in 'NJ'

##### Objective 2 - Age

* Take in two numbers between 1 and 100. How many people have an age between those given numbers
  
##### Objective 3 - Ethnicities

* Print out the ethnicities and the number of individuals for each ethnicity

##### Objective 4 - Population Ranking

* Print out the top 10 most populated states and their population, in order from largest to smallest

##### Objective 5 - Age Compare

* Write a method where a user can input one state or several states
* Return the average age of all the people in those state, in order from highest to lowest

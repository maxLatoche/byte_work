NYC Police Complaints
=====================

* Write an MVC application to present analysed data to a user.
* We'll be reading NYC police complaint data into a Pandas DataFrame from a CSV.

*A user should be able to:
	* see the five precinct / years with the most complaints
	* see the five precinct / years with the least complaints
	* see the average number of complaints
	* see the total number of complaints

### BONUS

* A user can:
	* see the total number of complaints by precint / command
	* see which year had the most total complaints
	* see which year had the least total complaints

***hint:*** We didn't use `.head()` and `.tail` in the last exercise. They may be useful here.

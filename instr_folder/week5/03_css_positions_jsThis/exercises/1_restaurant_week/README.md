# Welcome to Restaurant Week!

Mr. Jason opened his restaurant a two months ago. He opened it out of his love for food. Mr. Jason was such a good chef that his restaurant started to get packed. People would be lining up out the door. 

With so much money and success he decided to open up a second location. And what do you know, just in time for restaurant week. Now Mr. Jason thinks would be a great opportunity to open a website for his restaurant.

He has hired you for 10,000 doge coins to build the website. A wireframe is located in this folder. Your goal is to replicate it.

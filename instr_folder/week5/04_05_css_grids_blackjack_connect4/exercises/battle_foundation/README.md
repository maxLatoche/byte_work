# STAR WARS BATTLES!!!Hero Battles

##### Description

* Your mission should you choose to accept it, is to use CSS positioning to position the star wars character images and pit them against one another. Remember we do not like using `float` or `position: absolute` because these take the element out of the `normal document flow`

##### Objectives

* You have been given a folder with images
* Use CSS Positioning to position star wars characters to battle one another
	* Remember we do not like using `float` or `position: absolute`
* Make two rows of battles
* Every row should have `three 1v1` battles; so six characters
* Every battle must say `vs.` in between the two contenders

##### Bonus

* Using Foundation CSS how can you make this responsive where a full screen will show three battles in a row but a smaller screen will show each battle as it's own row. So scrolling down it's one battle at a time. 
* Using jQuery can you add clicking functionality where the user can choose who they would like to win? 
	* Maybe store the wins for each side? light vs dark?

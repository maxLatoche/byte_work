### Requirements

* Use Trello to plan out your goals for this project
* What are your user stories
* What type of functions are you thinking about
* What are your luxury goals
* Wireframe your site
* What will the board look like, the cards, the deck, buttons, text boxes to hold money or chips

### Project Details

* Make this a one player Black Jack game
* There is only one deck containing 52 cards
* The user should be able to enter their name


### Rules

* The goal is to get a hand to 21
	* All number cards are valued at their number
	* Jack, Queen, and King are valued at 10
	* The Ace can either count as 1 or 11 (This part is the hardest)
* The user has the option to "Hit" or "Stand" 
* If they hit they get a new random card
* If their hand exceeds 21 they "Bust"
* If they stand the AI will go
* The AI will keep hitting until it either busts or beats the users hand value

### Bonus

* Add money to the mix. The user can bet at the beginning of every turn before the cards are dealt
* If the user or AI are able to get five cards in their hand without going over 21 they automatically win
* If the user has two of the same card a third option opens up called "Split" 
	* Split allows the user to split their hand and play as if they have two hands. 
	* A user can split only up to four times
* Scale the decks, allow the user to choose between 1, 3, or 5 decks
* Add CSS shizzzzzz

# Making a Responsive Blog!

##### Objectives

* Using Foundation replicate the blog format from the screen shots. 
* The blog should be responsive using Foundation and will alter it's format when changing from a small screen to a large and vice versa
* Two folders have been provided for you. 
* An image folder with the images
* A `vendor` folder with the webicons
	
***NOTE***

* Using the web icon you may find the [docs here](http://zurb.com/playground/social-webicons)
* The docs DO NOT say you have to set "svg" as a parent class then the regular classes in the children. ALSO THE STUPID DOCS don't mention that the class name is no longer fc-webicon, it's just `webicon`

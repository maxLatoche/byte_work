Inherited Template
==================

Copy your basic HTML page from the last exercise into the `templates`
directory.

Use jinja2 templating, separate your HTML page into two files:
`base.html` and `content.html`.

`content.html` should extend `base.html`, and the page's title, header,
and content should be inserted dynamically by Flask and jinja2.

Once your page is rendering, change the values of `title`, `header`,
and `content` in `inherited_template.py`. What happens?

Render a Form and Return Pandas Info
====================================

Your form should accept three inputs:
* Year
* Column
* Function

The response should be a nicely formatted list of:
* the selected year
* the selected column
* the selected function
* the result

For the Pandas logic, you might re-use a lot of yesterday's code.

You'll also want to use the
[select](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select)
form element.

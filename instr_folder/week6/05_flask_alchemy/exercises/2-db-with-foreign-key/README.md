Simple Database
===============

Using SQLAlchemy, create a warehouse database with a table for
ThinkPads and a table for persons.

A ThinkPad has a model number and a serial number.

A person has a name.

A person can have many ThinkPads.

*Everything* has a primary key identifier. Everything *ever*, for the
rest of space and time, has a primary key identifier.

Populate this database with some really great people owning some
really great ThinkPads.

It might be helpful to begin by copying your files from the first
exercise into this directory, and modifying them.

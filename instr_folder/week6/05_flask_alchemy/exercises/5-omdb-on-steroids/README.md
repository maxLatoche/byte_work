* Alright we will build our first COMPLETE FULL STACK WEB APPLICATION. 

### Objectives 

* The following bullets should be available even if a user is not logged in
	* A User should be able to search for a movie
	* A User should be able to see all results for their search
	* A User should be able to click on a specific title for more details
* A User should be able to login with a username and password
* A User should be able to save their favorite movies
* A User should be able to delete any of their favorite movies
* A User should be able to view all their favorite movies

### Luxury Goals

* Allow users to rank movies
* Allow users to apply a movie to a specific category in their profile
* Allow users to filter their favorite movie list. 
* For Example if a user is in the mood for a specific genre
	* I want to see only Action
	* I want to see only Comedy
	* I want to see only Drama

### Finished This And Want More? 

* Check out this list of free public apis. Some of them require keys but they are all free.
	* [https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis)
* If you're sick of the OMDB API then feel free to pick an api from here that might interest you
* Your objectives should be similar to those above
* There must be some default functionality whether a user is logged in or not
* If a user is logged in they should have personal info that they can CRUD from. 

***If you choose to do a different API for your homework please let me know first***
